# Ethereum Layer 2s — A Practical Overview

Ethereum Layer 2s exist to scale Ethereum without sacrificing security.

Instead of increasing Ethereum’s base layer throughput, Layer 2s move execution off-chain while keeping settlement and security anchored on Ethereum.

## Why Layer 2s Matter

- Lower transaction costs
- Higher throughput
- Same underlying security guarantees

## High-Level Types

- Optimistic Rollups
- Zero-Knowledge Rollups

Each takes a different approach to fraud prevention and verification.
