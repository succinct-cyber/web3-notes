# DEXs vs Aggregators — How Liquidity Is Accessed

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) allow users to trade assets directly on-chain using smart contracts.

DEX aggregators sit on top of multiple DEXs, routing trades across them to achieve better execution.

## DEXs

DEXs provide liquidity through:
- Automated Market Makers (AMMs)
- Liquidity pools

Trade execution happens against a single protocol’s liquidity.

## Aggregators

Aggregators:
- Query multiple DEXs
- Split orders across venues
- Optimize for price impact and slippage

They do not own liquidity but coordinate access to it.

## Why Aggregators Matter

As DeFi liquidity becomes fragmented, aggregators act as an abstraction layer that improves user experience and capital efficiency.
