# Lending and Borrowing in DeFi

DeFi lending protocols allow users to supply assets to earn yield while enabling others to borrow against collateral.

These systems are typically overcollateralized to manage risk.

## Key Components

- Liquidity pools
- Interest rate models
- Collateralization ratios
- Liquidation mechanisms

## Why It Works

Smart contracts enforce rules automatically, removing the need for centralized intermediaries while maintaining transparency.
