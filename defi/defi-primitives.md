# DeFi Primitives — The Building Blocks

Decentralized Finance is composed of simple financial primitives that can be combined into complex systems.

Understanding these primitives makes it easier to reason about any DeFi protocol.

## Core Primitives

### 1. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)
Allow users to swap assets without intermediaries using smart contracts.

### 2. Lending and Borrowing
Users supply liquidity to earn yield, while borrowers access capital by providing collateral.

### 3. Stablecoins
Assets designed to maintain price stability, often acting as DeFi’s unit of account.

## Why Primitives Matter

Most DeFi protocols are not entirely new ideas — they are compositions of these basic primitives with different trade-offs.
