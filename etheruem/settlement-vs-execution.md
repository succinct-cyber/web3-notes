# Settlement vs Execution in Ethereum

Ethereum separates execution from settlement to enable scalability.

Execution refers to where transactions are processed, while settlement defines where final state is agreed upon.

## Execution Layer

- Handles transaction processing
- Calculates state transitions
- Often moved to Layer 2s for scalability

## Settlement Layer

- Finalizes transaction outcomes
- Provides security guarantees
- Ethereum Layer 1 acts as the settlement layer

## Why This Separation Matters

Decoupling execution from settlement allows Ethereum to scale without compromising decentralization or security.
