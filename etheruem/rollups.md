# Rollups — How Ethereum Scales

Rollups are Layer 2 solutions that execute transactions off-chain and post compressed data back to Ethereum.

Ethereum acts as the settlement and security layer.

## Key Idea

- Execution happens on Layer 2
- Data availability and settlement happen on Ethereum

## Rollup Types

### Optimistic Rollups
Assume transactions are valid by default, with fraud proofs used to challenge invalid state transitions.

### ZK Rollups
Use cryptographic proofs to verify state transitions before finalizing them on Ethereum.

## Trade-offs

Different rollup designs optimize for speed, cost, complexity, and developer experience.

## Why Rollups Are the Current Scaling Path

Ethereum’s roadmap favors rollups because they preserve decentralization while increasing throughput.

Rather than making Ethereum itself faster, rollups allow Ethereum to remain a secure base layer for settlement and data availability.
